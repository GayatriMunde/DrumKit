# DrumKit
#### A virtual drum kit, I did this project as a part of my #30daysOfJS. 
#### Difficulty Level: Easy

## Project Description
The point of this project is to have each key, when pressed, make a corresponding drum noise. It also uses CSS transitions and animations to make the project more interactive to the user.

## My Learning
- Eventlistner in JS
- DOM Manipulation
- Retrieving elements from the DOM is not limited to just “id”, “class”, and elements. You can also select DOM elements using the elements attributes.
